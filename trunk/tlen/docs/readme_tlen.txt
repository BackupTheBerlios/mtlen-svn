Tlen Protocol Plugin for Miranda IM
===================================

Introduction:
  Tlen is a protocol used by a propritary instant messaging network
  at tlen.pl. It is based on Jabber, and, therefore, this plugin
  is very much based on Jabber protocol plugin for Miranda. All
  necessary helps to create this Tlen plugin are from Adam Strzelecki.

Installation:
  Copy tlen.dll and (optional) tlen_czaty.dll to Miranda's plugins directory.

  If you want to have multiple Tlen accounts online at the same time,
  you need to have multiple copies of tlen.dll, each with different name,
  all in Miranda's plugins directory. Note that all configurations for a
  Tlen account (including your contact list) are associated with the
  DLL's name. In addition, it is highly recommended that you do NOT choose
  the name that is in conflict with other plugins or any database categories
  used by Miranda core (use DatabaseViewer or DatabaseEditor to see what
  database categories are already in use).
